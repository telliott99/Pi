I ordered

- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BDR5PDW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- (micro) [SD card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H5ZNOYG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [power supply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LCNF8FU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

It's only 16 GB but I don't expect to use it that much.

I also ordered a USB hub and a

- 32 GB [USB 3.0 drive](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015CH1JIW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
