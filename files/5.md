#### Orienting ourselves to the Pi

``$PATH``.  Print it with newlines:

```
$ echo $PATH | sed 's/:/\n/g'
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/sbin
/usr/bin
/sbin
/bin
/usr/local/games
/usr/games
```

Standard setup.  

In ``~``, there is no file ``.bash_profile``.  ``.bashrc`` is extensive but the PATH isn't set there.  It appears to be set in ``/etc/profile``.

As a test:

```
$ printf "export PATH=/usr/local/bin\n" > ~/.bash_profile
```

Check it with ``cat``.  Then after ``sudo reboot`` (and re-doing ``ssh``), I find that the change to the ``$PATH`` has taken effect.  To revert the change 

```
$ rm ~/.bash_profile
-bash: rm: command not found
```

That's amusing.  ``rm`` is no longer on my ``$PATH``.  Neither is ``ls``, ``mv``, ``cp`` or ``sudo``, or ``which``.

Luckily ``printf`` is.  Now where is ``rm`` located?

```
$ /bin/rm ~/.bash_profile
$ sudo reboot
-bash: sudo: command not found
$ bin/sudo reboot
-bash: bin/sudo: No such file or directory
```  

Turns out it works with ``/usr/bin/sudo reboot``.  

Re-login.
