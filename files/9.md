TL;DR

``sudo umount /dev/sda1`` works for a FAT32 disk/Volume, but not for a USB drive formatted with FAT32 + EXT4 with the Raspbian OS.

Another possibility is ``eject`` installed with ``apt-get``.

#### USB drives

To unplug a USB drive, you must first unmount it.  And to do that, you need to find it on the file system.  

```
pi@raspberrypi:/dev $ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/root        13G  4.6G  7.5G  39% /
devtmpfs        460M     0  460M   0% /dev
tmpfs           464M     0  464M   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           464M   13M  452M   3% /run
tmpfs           5.0M  4.0K  5.0M   1% /run/lock
tmpfs           464M     0  464M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/mmcblk0p6   68M   21M   47M  31% /boot
tmpfs            93M     0   93M   0% /run/user/1000
/dev/mmcblk0p5   30M  398K   28M   2% /media/pi/SETTINGS
/dev/sda5        30M  1.6M   27M   6% /media/pi/SETTINGS1
/dev/sda7        15G  4.4G  9.5G  32% /media/pi/root
/dev/sda8        68M   23M   46M  33% /media/pi/boot0
/dev/sda6        68M   23M   46M  33% /media/pi/boot
/dev/sda9        12G  1.1G  9.8G  10% /media/pi/root0
pi@raspberrypi:/dev $ 
```

``/dev/sdaX`` are the partitions of hard drive ``sda``.

People also suggest ``/proc/mounts | grep "boot"``

Hmmm...  try this:  shutdown the Pi, power off, unplug USB, power up and then compare:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/root        13G  4.6G  7.5G  39% /
devtmpfs        460M     0  460M   0% /dev
tmpfs           464M     0  464M   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           464M   13M  452M   3% /run
tmpfs           5.0M  4.0K  5.0M   1% /run/lock
tmpfs           464M     0  464M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/mmcblk0p6   68M   21M   47M  31% /boot
tmpfs            93M     0   93M   0% /run/user/1000
/dev/mmcblk0p5   30M  398K   28M   2% /media/pi/SETTINGS
```

So it looks like ``/dev/sda5 - /dev/sda9`` relate to my USB drive.

``umount`` seems to work:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo umount /dev/sda5
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo umount /dev/sda6
umount: /dev/sda6: not mounted
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo umount /dev/sda7
umount: /dev/sda7: mountpoint not found
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo umount /dev/sda8
pi@raspberrypi:~
```

but ``df -h`` reports the drive is still there.

Oh well.  Just ``sudo shutdown`` and unplug as before.

#### Try a simpler drive

On the Mac, reformat the drive the name ``TE`` as FAT32.  Eject and plug into the Pi.  The new line with ``df -h`` is:

```
/dev/sda1        29G  1.7M   29G   1% /media/pi/TE
```
Try eject:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ eject /dev/sda1
eject: unable to open `/dev/sda'
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo umount /dev/sda1
umount: /dev/sda1: not mounted
```

Despite the warning, ``eject`` worked as shown by ``df -h``.  That's why ``umount`` gives the message it does.  Cycle around again and do 

``` 
$ sudo umount /dev/sda1
$
```

We are good.  ``umount`` works fine.
