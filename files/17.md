#### Problem

The problem is that when a fresh copy of the Pi OS boots it generates a new Public/Private key pair.  Since the server's public key is saved in the client's ``~/.ssh/authorized_hosts`` file, the mismatch in keys prevents logon.

I wrote a [script](../unix-cmds/alias.md) to deal with the changed host problem described below.  

So I can just do ``kh``, which is an alias for

#### accepting a new host

The ``known_hosts`` file has the public keys for things I've ssh'd into in the past (including some I use all the time).

There are a bunch like ``192.30.252.128-131`` for Github, and ``192.30.253.112-113`` which is likely to be Github as well, plus more. 

Also ``localhost`` from old experiments with setting up a server on the Mac

At the very end

```
10.0.1.7 ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBNWzk2LUjCGPdWkSUtg3IV8p/cuk+m/BvxwjNI1rNYAUchlUtVf5QYrKXOLLwIWPVungMx1Xln3RsbleE3mC1ak=

```

This is the public key that I trusted the first time I ssh'd into the original Pi OS from the micro SD card.

I accepted it without checking it out, at the time.

This key is about 40% the size of the others, but that is not a bad thing, because it's an ecdsa key.  

And it's a good thing.  ec is for "elliptic curve" cryptography.

We want to navigate to ``/etc/ssh`` on the Pi.  That's where host keys for the ssh server are kept.

So we can do something caveman-ish like copy them both into Python and then compare

```
>>> host = "AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBNWzk2LUjCGPdWkSUtg3IV8p/cuk+m/BvxwjNI1rNYAUchlUtVf5QYrKXOLLwIWPVungMx1Xln3RsbleE3mC1ak="
>>> local = "AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBNWzk2LUjCGPdWkSUtg3IV8p/cuk+m/BvxwjNI1rNYAUchlUtVf5QYrKXOLLwIWPVungMx1Xln3RsbleE3mC1ak="
>>> host == local
True
>>>
```

There are easier ways.  One is to generate a key "fingerprint" from each file and compare those.

```
pi@raspberrypi:/etc/ssh $ ssh-keygen -lf ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
256 SHA256:dKh5LcmrjHphP3KgtkTmCjJFzECRIYrmfmEMpwgsS6o root@raspberrypi (ECDSA)
```

```
> ssh-keygen -lf known_hosts
..
256 SHA256:dKh5LcmrjHphP3KgtkTmCjJFzECRIYrmfmEMpwgsS6o 10.0.1.7 (ECDSA)
>
```

There is probably a simpler way to verify??
