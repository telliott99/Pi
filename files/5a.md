#### Bash profile

When you start up a bash shell, certain commands are executed.  One place to commands to execute is in a file ``.bash_profile`` in the home directory.

The leading ``.`` means this file is hidden to the file system as shown in the desktop GUI.

Here are some examples of things you might do:

- specify a different prompt:

```
PS1="> "
```

- construct short aliases for common commands

```
alias te='open -a TextEdit'
alias oh='open -a Safari _build/html/index.html'
alias ts='python typeset/scripts/script.py'
alias prp='pipenv run python'
```

(The first two are Mac specific).

- modify or replace your ``$PATH``

```
p0=$HOME/bin
p1=$HOME/Library/Python/2.7/bin
p2=$HOME/Library/Python/3.6/bin
export PATH=$p0:$p1:$p2:$PATH
```

Do other stuff.

```
export PW=verysecret
alias dgst="openssl dgst -hex -sha1 | cut -c -10"
```

I'll show you what that's about another time.
