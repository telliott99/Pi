### Disabling password login for ssh

TL;DR

- ``scp`` to copy my public key to the Pi directory/file: ``~/.ssh/authorized_keys``
- edit ``/etc/ssh/sshd_config`` on the Pi to read

```
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM no 
```

#### Enable Pubkey Authentication on the Pi

```
> ssh pi@10.0.1.7
pi@10.0.1.7's password: 
Linux raspberrypi 4.9.80-v7+ #1098 SMP Fri Mar 9 19:11:42 GMT 2018 armv7l
..
$ 
```

The Pi password is still ``raspberry``, even for login via ``ssh``.  I buried the complaint under ``..``.

We need to fix that now.

Following my [notes](https://github.com/telliott99/Ubuntu/blob/master/ssh1.md) on ssh, the first thing I want to do is examine the configuration file for the ssh server on the Pi.

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd /etc/ssh
pi@raspberrypi:/etc/ssh $ cat sshd_config
#	$OpenBSD: sshd_config,v 1.100 2016/08/15 12:32:04 naddy Exp $

# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.
...
pi@raspberrypi:/etc/ssh $ 

```

We are looking for a line like ``PubkeyAuthentication``:

```
pi@raspberrypi:/etc/ssh $ cat sshd_config | grep "Pubkey"
#PubkeyAuthentication yes
```

The ``#`` (comment) symbol means that this line is not currently active.  We need to edit the file and get rid of the ``#``, but it has to be done in a sudo way.

#### The easy way

There's a hard way and an easy way to do this.  The [easy way](https://askubuntu.com/questions/208378/how-do-i-copy-files-that-need-root-access-with-scp) is to do the edit on my Mac.  I use ``scp`` to grab a copy of the file.  From the Mac

```
> scp pi@10.0.1.7D:/etc/ssh/sshd_config ~/Desktop
pi@10.0.1.7's password: 
sshd_config           100% 3298   252.9KB/s   00:00    
```

Save a copy as ``sshd_config.orig``.

Edit line 37 to:

```
PubkeyAuthentication yes
```

Line 56 to:

```
PasswordAuthentication no
```

Line 84 to:

```
UsePAM no
```

Save as ``sshd_config``.

```
> diff sshd_config sshd_config.orig 
37c37
< PubkeyAuthentication yes
---
> #PubkeyAuthentication yes
56c56
< PasswordAuthentication no
---
> #PasswordAuthentication yes
84c84
< UsePAM no
---
> UsePAM yes
> 
```

Copy it back:

```
> scp ~/Desktop/sshd_config pi@10.0.1.7:~
pi@10.0.1.7's password: 
sshd_config           100% 3294   670.9KB/s   00:00    
>
```

And then put it in the right place.

```
$ sudo mv ~/sshd_config /etc/ssh
```


#### notes on vi

The hard way to do this is to use ``vi`` on the Pi.

I have used the ``vi`` editor in the past.  I find my notes from before:

```
sudo vi sshd_config
```

Sometimes the arrow keys don't work.  At moment they are.  

Basic vi commands [here](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html).

- i    insert text before cursor
- a    append text after cursor
- x    delete single character under cursor
- dd   delete entire line

``<esc>`` gets you out of edit mode (`x`` is not).

#### Editing the config file

Important!  First, save a copy of the original file.

```
$ sudo cp sshd_config sshd_config.orig
```

Now, for the edit:  ``sudo vi sshd_config``.  The down arrow <i>does</i> work.  

Scroll to the line identified above and do ``x``.  The ``#`` goes away.

Escape isn't needed (not in edit mode?) so I do ``:`` and then ``wq`` and it seems to have worked:

```
pi@raspberrypi:/etc/ssh $ diff sshd_config.orig sshd_config
37c37
< #PubkeyAuthentication yes
---
> PubkeyAuthentication yes
```

That looks right.

[ Update: if you must use the Pi, it's a much better idea to use ``nano``.  ``nano`` doesn't have edit mode, or the weird key combos.  It also has nice prompts. ]

#### We try it

Check the server's key fingerprint:

```
$ sudo ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
256 SHA256:JL+KgcerUmpza99wAsWgnSysjVvqPS5npFCn0HyhQ8s root@raspberrypi (ECDSA)
```

The key itself is:

```
$ sudo cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub 
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBJT+pkIYZ8pdCWySZGlYS2mEwPohYIsh9e5JQHUE6nkEd20e+wrLxYNTyzGz+0HobRuZipnezF2mXGayHUjr7vA= root@raspberrypi
```

Later I will find this on the Mac in ``known_hosts``:

```
10.0.1.7 ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBJT+pkIYZ8pdCWySZGlYS2mEwPohYIsh9e5JQHUE6nkEd20e+wrLxYNTyzGz+0HobRuZipnezF2mXGayHUjr7vA=
```

#### See if ssh works

**Important**:  apply the changes from the edit:

```
$ sudo service ssh restart
```

#### Move my public key to the Pi

The part that follows is a bit complicated because there was a problem that was hard to fix.  The reason it was hard to fix:

- I turned off Password Auth before testing Pubkey
- I trashed the original copy of ``sshd_config``

The reason for the problem was a matter of not having the target directory for the key ``~/.ssh`` and not having the right permissions and owner on the file ``authorized_keys``.  

Sometimes ``root`` ends up as owner when you do ``scp``, I don't know why yet, since ``scp`` does not run as root.

In any event read on if you want to see how I fixed it.

[docs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md)

I've written about SSH a lot elsewhere, including key generation.  Now I just copy my public key to the Pi

```
> ssh-copy-id pi@10.0.1.7
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/Users/telliott_admin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
pi@10.0.1.7: Permission denied (publickey).
>
```

That counts as a failure!  It may be because the directory ``~/.ssh`` doesn't exist.

```
$ cd ~/.ssh
-bash: cd: /home/pi/.ssh: No such file or directory
$ sudo mkdir ~/.ssh
```

Try again.  Nope.  It may be because the new directory has the wrong owner/permissions.

```
 $ ls -al ~/.ssh
total 8
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Mar  2 08:05 .
drwxr-xr-x 17 pi   pi   4096 Mar  2 08:05 ..
pi@raspberrypi:~/.ssh $ sudo chown $USER:$USER .
pi@raspberrypi:~/.ssh $ ls -al ~/.ssh
total 8
drwxr-xr-x  2 pi pi 4096 Mar  2 08:05 .
drwxr-xr-x 17 pi pi 4096 Mar  2 08:05 ..
pi@raspberrypi:~/.ssh $
```

Try again.  Nope.

OK, what we will do is manually copy the key over:

```
> scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@10.0.1.7:~
```

Nope.  

We've borked ssh somehow...

All that should be needed is to have ``~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`` as a file called ``authorized_keys`` in the ``~/.ssh`` directory on the Pi.

To fix this, we want to re-authorize Password Authentication on the Pi.  Unfortunately, I was so confident that I didn't keep a copy of the original config file!  So, go to the Pi console and use nano to edit ``/etc/ssh/sshd_confi`` line 56 and 84 (see above).  Then restart the server.

```
$ sudo service ssh restart
```

Password login by ssh should work now.  It does.  So does ``scp``.  From the Mac

```
> scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@10.0.1.7:~
pi@10.0.1.7's password: 
id_rsa.pub            100%  403   121.7KB/s   00:00    
>
```
On the Pi

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo cp ~/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
cat: /home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys: Permission denied
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls -al ~/.ssh
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  2 pi   pi   4096 Mar  2 08:22 .
drwxr-xr-x 17 pi   pi   4096 Mar  2 08:20 ..
-rwx------  1 root root  403 Mar  2 08:22 authorized_keys
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo chown pi:pi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls -al ~/.ssh
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  2 pi pi 4096 Mar  2 08:22 .
drwxr-xr-x 17 pi pi 4096 Mar  2 08:20 ..
-rwx------  1 pi pi  403 Mar  2 08:22 authorized_keys
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo chmod 755 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ 
```

Redo the copy of ``sshd_config``

```
> scp sshd_config pi@10.0.1.7:~
sshd_config           100% 3294   638.6KB/s   00:00    
> scp sshd_config.orig pi@10.0.1.7:~
sshd_config.orig      100% 3298   247.0KB/s   00:00    
>
```

```
$ sudo cp sshd_config /etc/ssh/
$ sudo service ssh restart
```

Now try again, and login works, no password needed.

```
> ssh pi@10.0.1.7
Last login: Sat Mar  2 08:20:22 2019 from 10.0.1.4

SSH is enabled and the default password for the 'pi' user has not been changed.
This is a security risk - please login as the 'pi' user and type 'passwd' to set a new password.

pi@raspberrypi:~ $
```
