#### WiFi

The default credentials for login on the Pi are:

```
username = pi
password = raspberry
```

If you are installing Stretch (i.e. not using NOOBS), you will be prompted during the first boot to set your WiFi. If not, you will have to set up WiFi on the Desktop.  

Find the network icon toward the right-hand end of the menu bar.  It'll have a red X if WiFi is not enabled.

To change or set configuration on the Pi, you can either click on the X-ed out WiFi symbol, or go to the Raspberry on the main menu and then choose

```
Raspberry > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration
```

which will show a window with tabs (System, Interfaces, Performance, Localization).  

Under the Localization tab you will find Set Locale and WiFi Country.  Locale is obvious but also we need to to set the country code.  Apparently, some regulation requires that WiFi be disabled until we do this.

#### Terminal

Alternatively, and especially in "headless" mode, Launch Terminal, and from the command line

```
sudo raspi-config
```

launches a text-only window which will allow you to set your netword id and password, and localization too.

```
SSID:  Apple Network e7d46b
passphrase:  ********
```

Now go to the Network icon and try DuckDuckGo > Google News and it works!

We'll look more at ``raspi-config`` later.
