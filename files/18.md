#### Generating a new key pair

After setting up the Pi for Pubkey Authentication, we will have a file ``authorized_keys`` under our home directory in ``~/.ssh/``.

There are also a set of key pairs in ``/etc/ssh/`` for the server, plus ``ssh_config`` and ``sshd_config`` files --- the latter is the one we edited, for the server.

Let's generate a new key pair for the user ``pi``.  The default key size is 2048, which is fine.

[docs](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/)

```
pi@raspberrypi:~/.ssh $ cd
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:6A1GU6BEzyaG7RcZF+TNl53lCoTuHknc1wtlPcIbfeQ pi@raspberrypi
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|   .o oo=. .o ..+|
|   + + * o.. * Xo|
|  . = O .oo.+ O.E|
|   o + +  +..+...|
|    . = So . .o .|
|     + o  +    . |
|      . .. .     |
|          .      |
|                 |
+----[SHA256]-----+
pi@raspberrypi:~ $  
```

For the example in the next file, I need a passphrase:  ``password``.

Now, we could go to a site like github, transfer over the public key in ``~/ssh/id_rsa.pub`` and then authenticate using what is, under the hood, ssh.

To look at the fingerprint for a key do ``ssh-keygen -lf <path>``, where ``-l`` means list and ``-f`` means file:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
2048 SHA256:6A1GU6BEzyaG7RcZF+TNl53lCoTuHknc1wtlPcIbfeQ pi@raspberrypi (RSA)
```
