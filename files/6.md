#### Other copy stuff

If we are using the remote desktop, then we must use the Linux commands, for example to copy-paste.

On Linux, generally it's ``CTRL + <key>`` rather than ``CMD + <key>`` as I'm used to on the Mac.

Terminal (from the remote desktop) requires ``SHIFT + CTRL + <key>``.  If I do ``SHIFT + CTRL + C`` to copy text, it can be pasted into a file on the Pi, but it isn't copied to the Mac's clipboard.

If you're in an ssh session, then you can just ``cat`` some file and copy it from the Terminal using  ``CMD + C``

If you're not

```
ssh pi@10.0.1.7 'cat ~/Desktop/p.c' > p.c
```
works.
