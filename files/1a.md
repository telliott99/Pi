#### ssh server

TL;DR

- activate ssh on the Pi
- find the Pi's ip address: mine is usually 10.0.1.7
- do ``ssh pi@<ip-address>`` on the client (my Mac)

#### ssh

Activate SSH on the Desktop using

```
Raspberry > Configuration > Interfaces
```

Toggle SSH.

#### ip address

Find the ip address of the Pi from the command line (Terminal), my router always gives me the same one:

```
$ ifconfig
```

You should see a section in the output of this command starting with ``wlan0``.  The second line is ``inet 10.0.1.7``.

``hostname -I`` will also do it.

It is possible to change the hostname for the Pi, when you are doing the network setup.  

The default is ``raspberrypi``.  

A trick is that from another machine on the local network you must add ``.local`` so another way is (from the Mac)

```
> ping raspberrypi.local
PING raspberrypi.local (10.0.1.7): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.0.1.7: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=321.381 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.1.7: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=5.528 ms
..
```

The difference in times is due to the fact that the Pi was asleep.

#### Connecting

On my Mac:

```
> ssh pi@10.0.1.7
The authenticity of host '10.0.1.7 (10.0.1.7)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:JL+KgcerUmpza99wAsWgnSysjVvqPS5npFCn0HyhQ8s.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? y
Please type 'yes' or 'no': yes
```

```
Warning: Permanently added '10.0.1.7' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
pi@10.0.1.7's password: 
```

The password is "raspberry".

```

SSH is enabled and the default password for the 'pi' user has not been changed.
This is a security risk - please login as the 'pi' user and type 'passwd' to set a new password.

pi@raspberrypi:~ $
```

We are good.

Again, to use the hostname "raspberry" on the network, you must add ``.local``.

```
> ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
The authenticity of host 'raspberrypi.local (fe80::2e13:7767:66f1:43e3%en0)' can't be established.

pi@raspberrypi.local's password:
```

We must accept the server key again.  On the clien, server public keys are stored here:

```
> cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts | tail -n 2
10.0.1.7 ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBJT+pkIYZ8pdCWySZGlYS2mEwPohYIsh9e5JQHUE6nkEd20e+wrLxYNTyzGz+0HobRuZipnezF2mXGayHUjr7vA=

>
```

Every time a new copy of the OS is installed, a new key pair is generated.  Login will fail until you "forget" the old key for that ip address or host name by removing it from ``~/.ssh/known_hosts``.  This Python [script](../auto-setup/setup/kill_previous) will do that.

At this point

```
$ sudo shutdown -r now
```

Reboots.  Leave off the ``-r`` flag to really shutdown, and then just turn the power off.

Pi does not prompt for my password for sudo stuff but does require ``sudo``.  ``sudo`` has been configured not to require a password.  We'll see how this is done later.
