Keyboard layout is in 
/etc/default/keyboard
/etc/default/console-setup

but recommended approach is to edit via

dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
dpkg-reconfigure console-setup

manual pages for keyboard, console-setup



From raspi-config source:

keyboard:

dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
invoke-rc.d keyboard-setup start

dpkg-reconfigure locales


Write a script to find dead links in my markdown.
