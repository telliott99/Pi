#### Effects of running ``raspi-config``

Because I have been unable to discover how to script the setup of Locale, Keyboard, Console, etc., I decided to try:

- booting with lite-wifi.img
- run ``raspi-config``, make changes
- save as lite-config.img
- reboot from saved image

The files which hold configuration data are in ``/etc/default/``.

#### Keyboard

``/etc/default/keyboard`` now has

```
XKBMODEL="apple"
XKBLAYOUT="us"
XKBVARIANT=""
XKBOPTIONS=""

BACKSPACE="guess"
```

Previously the first two items were:

```
XKBMODEL="pc105"
XKBLAYOUT="gb"
```

The ``~`` and ``|`` keys work correctly.

#### Locale

``locale`` has 

```
#  File generated by update-locale
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

whereas previously the second line was

```
LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
```

#### Console

``console-setup`` has

```
ACTIVE_CONSOLES="/dev/tty[1-6]"

CHARMAP="UTF-8"

CODESET="guess"
FONTFACE=""
FONTSIZE=""

VIDEOMODE=
```

which is unchanged.

``networking`` has no uncommented lines and ``ssh`` has only ``SSHD_OPTS=``.
