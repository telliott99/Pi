#### Login form and tokens

Remember I said we wouldn't change the app as we go along.  Well, I changed my mind.  I'm doing this to make the app less cluttered.

At the end of last time, we reverted our changes and saved them as ``app-mod.py`` and ``config-mod.py`` and here, those files have been renamed to the usual names.
